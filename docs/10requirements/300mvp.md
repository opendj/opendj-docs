# Minimum Viable Product

Motto: My kids should be able to demo the Idea to their friends. 
Showcase the idea/concept/vision to Red Hat external people. 

## Scope
1. Users  can do a simple search by Artist/track Title and add from search result to the end of the playlist
1. Curators  have their own view (e.g. with additional info of BPM of the track) 
1. Curators can re-order playlist(drag/drop or up/down buttons)
1. Available in public internet
1. No issues with expiring tokens - should be always online / demoable

## Out Of Scope
Please note that this makes explicitly  out of scope of the MVP:
1. Multi Tenancy / MusicEvents  - single event with constant ID, all public only
1. Forking of playlists -  single Playlist Only
1. Like/dislike of Events
1. No high availability -  singleton components only okay
