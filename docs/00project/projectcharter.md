# Project Charter

This defines the charter of the project, what are the goals and how do we interact.

## Essence of this Project
The essence of this project is to design,build and run a solution called "OpenDJ". The highlevel functional scope is define in the [README.md]. More details can be found in the [requirement documentation](/docs/10requirements/100requirements.md) and the [mvp definition](/docs/10requirements/300mvp.md)

## Background
This project was started by dfroehli@redhat.com during a Red Hat Solution Architect Hackathon in April 2019. 

## Spare Ressources  
We have very limited and sparse resources - be sure not to waste time on stuff others are also doing. 

## Visibility
Make sure it is visible what you are doing by creating/taking an issue. If your are working on it, it should be in state "In progress" and assigend to you, so everybody else can easily see it.

## Open Source to the rescue 
Make sure everything you do is visible in the public github repo! Avoid Red Hat internal Resource (GDocs, Mojo etc.) as much as possible. But don't be stupid and add private stuff (credentials, keys, etc.) to public github. 

## Definition of Done
A task is considered done when:
1. All artifacts are committed to github and pushed (to the master branch?)
1. Integration and Test on the Dev/Tst Stage completed successfully (automatically?)
1. Documentation is present / updated, commited and pushed
1. A peer review would be nice - has someone else taken a look on your contributed? Highly Recommended! Push your stuff, assign the ticket for review to a team mate.
1. Ticket is moved to DONE in Board

## Best Idea wins
If you have a better idea or see something in an artefact that you dont like - Open a Issue! We are always happy to listen and discuss new ideas!

## Documentation of Decisions
A lot of stuff needs to be decided. The discussion and decision needs to be documents.  
The process should be:
1. Open a Issue with the question at hand
1. For Each option, add a comment describing the option, the pros and the content. Note that you can edit a comment if you would like to add information, arguments
1. Contributors can add their opinions / in additional comments
1. Once a decision is being made, it is added as final comment who decided for what and why.
1. The decision needs to be documented somewhere in the docs folder (e.g. architecure) in a document, summarizing the question, options and decision and referring to the ticket for details.

## Project Management Approach
We use an agile, kanban style project approach. Everybody grabs a ticket and works and the topic he can contribute to. Due to the limited resources we have, there are not fixed sprint durations.

## Meetings
There is a loosley bi-weekly call. Sent an email to dfroehli@redhat.com if you want to participate.

## Development Approach
We try to follow this [development approach](developmentapproach.md)

## Motivation to Contribute
There are different motivations to participate / contribute / follow this project. All are respected and valuable.
1. like the vision of OpenDJ, make it it happen
1. interested in implementing a modern app dev in an agile way. learn about the methods, tools, architecture und technology
1. simply have fun in hacking
1. learn about Red Hat Technology und use the project as demo / showcase. Explain typical problems of cloud native app dev to Red Hat customers.


## Private Time vs Business Time  
Be aware of private vs. business conflict! Use Red Hat values of FREEDOM and RESPONSIBILITY wisely. 
Rule of Thumb: If you can use it to build skills, demo at customer, Red Hat technology is involved, etc -  then it is BUSINESS and okay during WORKING  hours. If it is about OpemDJ core functionality, nice to have features of OpenDJ etc., it is PRIVATE and should be done in AFTER hours. If you THINK about it, then it actually is EASY to decide.
